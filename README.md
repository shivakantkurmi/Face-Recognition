Face Recognition
This project implements a face recognition system using deep learning techniques. It can identify and recognize faces from images or video streams in real-time. The model is built using popular machine learning libraries and trained on a dataset of facial images.

Features
Real-time Face Detection: Detect faces from live video streams or images.
Face Recognition: Identify and recognize known faces using a trained model.
Preprocessing: Includes face alignment, resizing, and feature extraction.
Scalable: Easily add new faces to the recognition system by updating the dataset.
Customizable: Modify parameters and models for enhanced performance.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
OpenCV: For video and image processing.
Dlib: For face detection and landmark detection.
Face_recognition Library: To handle the core face recognition tasks.
Numpy & Pandas: For data manipulation.
Keras/TensorFlow (optional): To train custom deep learning models if needed.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shivakantkurmi/Face-Recognition.git
cd Face-Recognition
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Install dlib: Follow instructions from dlib's official site to install dlib.

Usage
Running Face Recognition on Images:

Place your test images in the images/ folder.
Run the script to detect and recognize faces:
bash
Copy code
python recognize_faces_image.py --image <path_to_image>
Running Real-time Face Recognition:

Ensure your webcam is connected and run the script:
bash
Copy code
python recognize_faces_video.py
Adding New Faces:

Add new images to the dataset/ folder and update the dataset by running the script:
bash
Copy code
python encode_faces.py
Dataset
The model can be trained with any dataset of facial images. You can add images to the dataset/ directory, where each person’s images are stored in separate subfolders (named with the person’s name).

Customization
You can adjust the detection threshold and model parameters by modifying the configuration in config.py.
For larger datasets, consider using GPU acceleration by installing TensorFlow with GPU support.
Future Enhancements
Integrating a GUI for user-friendly interaction.
Improving recognition speed with advanced deep learning models.
Adding support for recognizing faces from low-resolution images.
