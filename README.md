This project is a face recognition application built using Python. It allows users to detect and recognize faces from images or live video streams in real-time. The application uses popular machine learning libraries and stores faces for recognition using a dataset.

## Features

- Detect faces from images and live video streams
- Recognize known faces in real-time
- Add new faces to the dataset for future recognition
- Edit model configurations for improved accuracy
- Store the dataset locally for future use
